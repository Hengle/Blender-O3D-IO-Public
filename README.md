[En FranÃ§ais](README-FR.md) (Merci a [@boingtheboeing](https://github.com/boingtheboeing) pour la traduction)

A plugin supporting blender 2.79-3.x for importing and exporting OMSI .sco, .cfg, and .o3d files.

## Features
Blender-O3D-IO includes a fast o3d file importer and exporter with full support for the format. For complex models, 
`.cfg` and `.sco` files can also be imported and exported. OMSI map tiles (`.map` files) can also be imported.

 - Fully supports O3D file format:
    - Explicit vertex normals
    - Long headers (version >= 3)
    - Encryption (requires private `o3d_crypto.py` module)
    - Long triangle indices
    - Alternative encryption seed
    - Embedded materials
    - Bones
    - UV coordinates
 - Supports many features in CFG/SCO files:
    - LODs
    - Imports and exports advanced material features including:
       - `[matl]`
       - `[matl_alpha]`
       - `[matl_transmap]`
       - `[matl_envmap]` & `[matl_envmap_mask]`
       - `[matl_bumpmap]` (Blender >= 2.80 only!)
       - `[matl_nightmap]` & `[matl_lightmap]`
       - ...
    - Interior lights and spotlights
    - Lens flares (`[light_enh]` and `[light_enh_2]`)
    - Imports all referenced models (o3d files only) and textures in the CFG/SCO as separate objects
    - Imports `.x` if a compatible importer is installed (https://github.com/Poikilos/io_import_x)
 - Imports OMSI map tiles (`.map` files): [WIP]
    - Imports referenced scenery objects
    - Imports terrain tiles and materials
    - Imports splines and converts them to meshes

## Installation
1. Go to the releases page and download the latest release (available 
[here](https://github.com/space928/Blender-O3D-IO-Public/releases/latest)), it should look like 
`Blender-O3D-IO-Public-0.2.3.zip`
2. Open Blender go to `Edit->Preferences...`
3. Go to the `Add-ons` tab and then press `Install...`
4. Select the **zip** file (do NOT unzip it) and press `Install Add-on`
5. You should now be able to import o3d/cfg/sco files from `File->Import->OMSI Model Config (*.cfg, *.sco, *.o3d)`
6. Map tiles can be imported from `File->Import->OMSI Map Tile (*.map)`
7. You can export o3d/cfg/sco files from `File->Export->OMSI Model Config (*.cfg, *.sco, *.o3d)`

## Exporter Tips
OMSI and Blender handle 3D models and materials fairly differently so there are a few areas where the conversion between 
Blender and OMSI is a bit imprecise, this is most notable when exporting as there are a few assumptions the exporter 
needs to make to export files correctly. The exporter is designed to try as closely as possible to export an imported 
cfg file identically to the original. As such, the best way to learn the specifics of the exporter is to try importing 
some files, and examine how the importer sets them up in Blender.

### How do I export CFG files instead of just O3D files?
The exporter decides what to export based on the file extension of the exported file. To export a cfg along with all 
its required o3d files, specify the `.cfg` file extension when exporting. When exporting a single mesh as an o3d, a 
single o3d file is produced; if on the other hand you're exporting multiple Blender objects as an o3d then the exporter
automatically creates separate o3d files for each Blender object, this behaviour can't be changed.

For instance if the scene contains the following objects:
```
Scene Collection
| > Body
| > Wheel_H
| > Wheel_VL
| > Wheel_VR
```
If we enable the "Export selection" option in the export dialog, then we can control which objects are exported.
With only the `Body` selected, if we export as `Body.o3d` we indeed end up with a single o3d file `Body.o3d`. If on the 
other hand we select all the objects and export as `Car.o3d` the exporter will automatically export separate files for 
each object:
```
Car-Body.o3d
Car-Wheel_H.o3d
Car-Wheel_VL.o3d
Car-Wheel_VR.o3d
```
If we export as `Car.cfg` then the behaviour is the same, except the o3d files are not prefixed with the file name and 
a cfg file is also generated:
```
Car.cfg
Body.o3d
Wheel_H.o3d
Wheel_VL.o3d
Wheel_VR.o3d
```

### Materials Don't Look Correct in OMSI
Blender uses a completely different shading system to OMSI so there are some limitations to consider when exporting 
materials:
 - Some material features require a cfg file to exported to work correctly (transparency, envmaps, lightmaps, etc...)
 - If textures aren't displaying in OMSI check the following:
   - Blender supports image formats that OMSI doesn't, if possible use dds files for textures, these are best optimised 
     for OMSI and will generally load faster. (OMSI only supports DXT compression in DDS files)
   - Make sure the texture file exists in the correct textures directory in OMSI, the exporter converts all texture 
     filepaths to relative paths, so the texture must be in the correct place relative to the o3d/cfg file for omsi to 
     find it.
 - Only the following material fields are exported:
   - Base Color/Diffuse Color
   - Alpha
   - Specular Color/Specular Intensity
   - Roughness/Specular Hardness (when the roughness is set below 0.1, the envmap is automatically enabled)
   - Emission Color
   - 
   - Base Color Texture
   - Alpha Texture
   - Specular Texture
   - Normalmap (treated as a bumpmap)
   - Emission Texture (exported as a `[matl_lightmap]` if the emission strength is greater than 1, otherwise it's 
     exported as a `[matl_nightmap]`)
 - Animating material properties is not supported
 - When using shader nodes (the default in Blender >= 2.80), the **only** node supported as an input to the *Principled 
   BSDF Node*, is the *Image Texture* node

### How Does the Importer Handle OMSI Specific Data?
The importer is designed to preserve as much data from the cfg file as possible, including metadata not used in Blender 
such as `[CTC_Texture]`, these configuration items are stored in the "Custom Properties" section of the relevant object 
in Blender. Scene specific config items are stored in the "Custom Properties" section of the Scene tab, the "Object 
Properties", "Data Properties" (Mesh/Light tab), and "Material Properties" tabs also have configuration items stored in 
their "Custom Properties" sections. This data can be added to or modified and will be exported in the correct place by 
the exporter, but it's very easy to break it. I don't recommend modifying this data unless you know what you're doing.

### Light Flares
Blender doesn't support light flares, but to allow for easy positioning of flares `[light_enh_2]` the importer creates
EMPTY objects in the correct position with the all of the properties of the flare available to modifiy in the "Custom 
Properties" section of the "Object Properties" tab for that object (with the exception of colour, texture, and size 
which are controlled from the object data properties (color is controlled from 
"Object Properties->Viewport Display->Color")).

### Lights
All point lights are exported as `[interiorlight]` objects. Only the following properties are exported:
 - Location
 - Light Energy (scaled down by a factor of 10 to be used as range) [Blender >= 2.80]
 - Light Distance [Blender <= 2.79]
 - Light Color
 - Light Variable (from "Custom Properties")

All spotlights are exported as `[spotlight]` objects. Only the following properties are exported:
 - Location
 - Rotation (converted to spot direction vector)
 - Light Energy (scaled down by a factor of 10 to be used as range) [Blender >= 2.80]
 - Light Distance [Blender <= 2.79]
 - Light Color
 - Light Spot Size
 - Light Spot Blend (Converted to inner angle)

### How Do I Prevent Objects From Being Exported?
There are two methods:
#### 1:
Enable the "Export selection" option in the export dialog (on the right-hand side of the file picker) and then select 
all the objects you want to export.

#### 2:
For each object you want to prevent from being exported, go to it's "Object Properties" tab, and in the 
"Custom Properties" section add a property with the name "skip_export" (the property type is unimportant as its value 
is ignored).

### Animations
Currently, these are not imported, if an imported cfg file contains animations they should be re-exported correctly 
(they are preserved in "Custom Properties"). But no method currently exists to convert Blender animation to OMSI 
animations. That being said, object pivot points are correctly exported, and setting these up correctly is vital to 
animations working correctly in OMSI.

### LODs
LODs are automatically exported based on collection (or groups in Blender 2.79) names. Objects in a collection with a 
name of the form `LOD_X`, where `X` is a decimal number representing the minimum screen size, are exported in that LOD.
